        <p class="text-muted">DIA‚Äôs school playground is like a mini universe of fun, laughter, and learning!
             It's a designated area within a school where kids can run, play, and socialise during breaks and 
             recess. Playgrounds often have various equipment like swings, slides, jungle gyms, monkey bars, 
             seesaws, and sometimes even sports courts or fields. The fun of this playground started in September 10, 2005.

                and curiosity knows no bounds. But it's not just about the books; it's the atmosphere! The ambiance here is something magical. Soft lighting,
                 comfortable reading nooks, and the gentle hum of eager minds diving into their chosen books. It's an environment designed to spark imagination 
                 and foster a love for learning.
